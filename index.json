This can include contract law, family law and other areas.\n\r\r\rCriminal law vs. Civil law\r\r    Criminal Law Civil Law     Concept Related to conduct of which the State disapproves and which it seeks to control.Public Involves the relaltionships between individual citizens   Purpose To regulate socialty To settle disputes   Achieved by Punishment or penalty Compensation   Parties involved Prosecution vs. Accused Claimant vs. Defendant   Terminology Accused may be guilty Defendant may be liable   Burden of proof Prosecution Claimant   Standard of proof guilt must be shown beyond reasonable doubt liability must be shown on the balance of probability    \r\r\rThe court system\r\r\r\r\rHierarchy of courts\r\r\r\r\rThe three-track system\r\rIt is applicable to civil cases and court only\n   Types of cases  First instance Appeal     Small claims Up to ￡10000 County High   First track ￡10k~25K County High   Multi track over 25k, over one day County or high Court of appeal    \r\r\rSource of law\r\rEuropean Union law takes precedence over all other sources.\nLegislation takes precedence over case law\nEquity prevails over common law\n\r\r\rCase law\r\rcase law can be subdivided into common law and equity\n\r\r\rDoctrine of judicial precedent\r\rThe system, adopted by the judges, of following the decision in previous cases is called the doctrine of judicial precedent.\n Some precedents are binding (meaning they must be followed in later cases) Others are merely persuasive (meaning that the judge in a later case may choose to follow it but not bound to do so )  Three factors in deciding whether a precedent is binding or persuasive\n the hierarchy of the courts ratio decidendi and obiter dicta the material of facts  \r\r\rThe hierarchy of the courts\r\rIn general, the precedents of higher courts bind lower courts, but not vice versa\nThe Supreme Court does not bind itself, and The County Court dose not bind itself.\nThe Court of Appeal binds itself.\nThe High Court does not bind itself, but the Divisional Court of the Queen’s Bench Division binds the High Court.\nThe Crown Court bind no one.\n\r\r\rRatio decidendi and obiter dicta\r\rThe ratio decidendi is the legal reaason for the decision. It is capable of the binding precedent. It is a statement of law which is carried down to later decisions.\nObiter dicta are statements which are not part of the ratio. They are persuasive rather than binding. This mean that the judge can take the statement into account when reaching their decision, but they dose not have to follow it.\n\r\r\rFacts of case\r\rIn order for a precedent to be binding, the material fact of the two cases must be the same.\n\r\r\rWhen is a precedent not binding\r\rA precedent is not bining where it:\n  has been overruled by a higher court\n  has been overruled by statutes\n  was made without proper care(per incuriam)\nThis is where a decision of a court is held to be wrongly decided becuase the judge was misinformed of a law.\nA judgement per incuriam is not binding and no authority.\n  can be distinguished from the earlier case I.e. the material facts differ.\nA previous case is only binding in a later case if the legal principle involved is the same and the facts are similar.\nWhere the acts are materially different then a previous decisions dose not need to be followed.\n  \r\r\rAdvantages and disadvantages of judicial precedent\r\r\r\r\rAdvantages\r\r  Reaching decisions as a result of thr doctrine of precedent makes the system consistent. Be predictable to the reslut of litigation.\n  It allows the English law system to be flexible.\nDecisions can be adapted and extended to reflect changes of in society.\n  The law is clear.\nOnly the ratio decidendi that is followed. It is easy to see what law is being applied.\n  Decisions arise from actual events, therefore the sysytem is practical.\n  \r\r\rDisadvantages\r\r  The law is vary complex.\nBecuase there is a vast number of cases, and inconsistencies can arise. The same judgement may contain differing, even conflicting, arguements making the precedent hard to understand and even hard to apply.\n  The law can become rigid, leading the inflexibiity and loss of development.\n  Case law is reactive rather than proactive.\nRather than dealing with issues in advance and stating the law, a case is considered and a decision made once a particular situation has arisen.\n  \r\r\rLegislation\r\r\r\r\rTypes of legislation\r\rTwo categories:\n Acts of Parliament Delegated legislation  \r\r\rActs of parliament\r\rParliament consists of:\n the House of Commons the House of lords the Monarch  Parliamentary proceedings:\n  First Reading: reading out the names\n  Second Reading: debate and voting\n  Committee Stage: scrutiny by a smaller number of members\n  Report Stage: reporting the amended Bill to the House\n  Third Reading: final reading and voting\n  Royal Assent: approval by the Queen\n  The Bill (the proposed Statute) may be started in any House, however, if it passes through one House, the procedure should be repeated in the other House.\n\r\r\rDoctrine of sovereignrt of Parliament\r\rParliament is sovereign:\n Only Parliament can make a new statute. Parliament has the power to make any law. The Courts cannot question the validity of an Act (and cannot overrule it), but must refuse to apply any Act that contravenes EU law.  Parliament can:\n Repeal earlier legislation and overrule case law, Make a new law.  \r\r\rDelegated legislation\r\rFor many reasons, Parliament has delegated some of its legislative powers to other bodies. Such delegation is exercised by an ‘ enabling Act ’ containing the main objectives of the proposed secondary legislation.\nRules enacted under such power are called delegated legislation, and the following are some exemple:\n statutory instruments: made by Goverment Ministers bye-laws: made by local authorities Other in council: made by the Privy Council in the name of the Monarch on the advice of the Prime minister.
